# Web-Student-Tracker-JSP-Servlets-
I have created a Student-Tracker web application using JSP and Servlets. 
The web app keeps a track of students. 
I have implemented basic CRUD features to create, view, update and delete students. 
I have also implemented the search feature. 
I have used MySQL to store students in the database and Tomcat for the server.
